# Charter Coding Challenge

1. Clone the repo to your local machine
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/BobbyErickson89/charter.git
   ```
2. Run an ```npm install``` to get the dependencies needed to run the site
3. Run ```npm start``` to run the page locally.

- The dummy data can be found under the public/db folder.  I just created data within the last 3 months since the directions said that's what was needed.
- The main table just shows customer names and their total reward points.  If you click on a customers row, a modal pops up giving a breakdown of their purchases over the last 3 months.
